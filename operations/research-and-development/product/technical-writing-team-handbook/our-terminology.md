# Terminology

The language we use at Mattermost is extremely important. When we use consistent terminology it means we're all speaking the same language, and our customers know what to expect whether they're on the website or in the product documentation.

Terminology standardization started in 2022. The project has a large scope and includes:

- Standardizing headings to make them sentence case. This was completed in Q1 of 2022.
- Standardizing all text in the System Console to make them sentence case.
- Standardizing how we refer to our products and plans, as well as the mechanisms available to use them.
- Making our Edition and License page consistent and clear.
- Creating a UI text library of terms and strings for the UX team to use when creating mocks.

The [outline of the project is documented here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImzS3UhCkFzMF2-6FNByw9W2r8Gvx1sudBA0FjazVH0/edit#heading=h.crjl4fz9pz1n).

## Product terminology

"Mattermost sells subscription plans for both cloud and self-hosted deployment. Self-hosted deployments will need to upload a license file to activate the subscription."

All of our products are subscription plans. However, our self-hosted deployments also require a license file which is downloaded during the purchase process.
